# WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 — PC Port

This is a native Windows port of the 2010 Xbox 360 game *WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011*. It isn't an emulator. The game's code is statically recompiled to C++ with the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) and built into an ordinary Windows program. It runs on the SDK's Xenia-derived runtime, draws with Direct3D 12, plays sound through XAudio2 and reads controllers through XInput.

It also adds:

- **Sharp resolutions**: 720p (the console's), 900p, 1080p, 1440p and 4K, with anti-aliasing, VSync and a steady 60 fps, even in the heaviest entrances.
- **Any screen shape**: on ultrawide monitors, the Steam Deck and foldable phones, matches and entrances fill the whole screen, with more of the arena in view and nothing stretched. Menus keep the original 16:9 picture.
- **A launcher** that installs the game from your disc image, keeps it up to date, and manages settings, saves, DLC, logos and movies.
- **Your own entrance music**: *Create An Entrance → Music → USER PLAYLIST* plays songs from a folder on your PC, as the Xbox 360 did from its hard drive.
- **Your own entrance movies**: turn any video into a titantron movie in the launcher and pick it in *Create An Entrance*.
- **Up to 10 HD logos** on a created superstar, instead of the game's limit of 2.
- **Paint Tool import and export**: put any image into the game's Paint Tool, or save its logos as PNGs.
- **Type on your PC keyboard** wherever the game shows its on-screen keyboard: superstar names, Story Designer text and more.
- **Saves as plain files** that you can back up, copy and share.
- **Five languages**: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian (the game's own text), chosen in the launcher or in game.
- **Android**: the full game on phones and tablets, with on-screen touch controls you can rearrange, or a controller.
- **Discord**: shows what you're playing (menus, entrances, a match) on your Discord profile.
- **An experimental Vulkan renderer**: the native renderer on Vulkan as well as Direct3D 12 (Settings → Renderer → *Native Vulkan (EXPERIMENTAL)*), the groundwork for Linux and Android.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository has no game in it.** It holds no disc image, XEX, game data, movies, music or recompiled game code. You need your **own copy of the Xbox 360 game**. Make a disc image of it (`.iso`), then point the launcher at that image.

> [!NOTE]
> **This port was made with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**, Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Claude Code wrote most of the port's code, tools and docs, working with the project's human author, who directed, tested and played it. See [Contributors](#contributors).

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| 💿 **The game** | A disc image of your own *WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011* **Xbox 360** disc, as an `.iso`. The PS3, Wii, PS2 and PSP versions won't work. |
| 🖥️ **PC** | Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit). A graphics card with Direct3D 12. A CPU from about 2009 or later (SSE4.2). It also runs on a **Steam Deck** (55–60 fps) and Linux PCs through Proton: see [Steam Deck and Linux](#steam-deck-and-linux-proton). |
| 💾 **Disk space** | About 6 GB: 5.3 GB for the game, plus room for saves and caches. |
| 🎮 **Controller** | An Xbox controller (Xbox 360, Xbox One or Series). Other gamepads work through SDL. |

## Install and play

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/install-flow.svg" alt="Disc image, then Launcher Install, then Settings, then Play" width="100%">
</p>

1. **Download** the latest zip from [**Releases**](https://github.com/KaikoClanworth1/wwe-svr2011-pc/releases/latest) and unzip it anywhere. It holds the launcher and the game program, with no game data.
2. **Make a disc image** of your Xbox 360 game disc, as an `.iso`.
3. **Open `SvR2011 Launcher.exe`** and go to the **Install** tab:
   1. Under **Your disc image**, choose your `.iso`.
   2. Under **Install to**, choose an empty folder.
   3. Click **Install**. The launcher only reads the image and never changes it. It copies the game out (about 5.3 GB) and puts the PC program beside it. If you stop it, click **Install** again later and it carries on where it left off.
4. **Settings tab**: pick windowed or fullscreen, the resolution, VSync and so on.
5. **Play tab**: press **Play**.

Your saves go to `Saves\` inside the game folder.

### Updates

From version 0.2.0 the launcher **updates itself**. When it starts, it checks this repository's releases. If there's a newer one, it asks, downloads it, replaces the program files and restarts. Your saves, settings, music and movies are kept. The **Updates** box on the **Play** tab shows your version, has a **Check for updates** button, and can turn the check at start off.

**Coming from v0.1.0:** that version has no updater. Download v0.2.0 once, unzip it, open its launcher, and click **Install** into your game folder. Files already there are skipped.

### Steam Deck and Linux (Proton)

The port is a Windows program. On a Steam Deck or a Linux PC it runs through **Proton**, Steam's compatibility layer, with the native renderer at **55–60 fps on a Steam Deck**. Linux PCs other than the Deck haven't been tested yet. If something goes wrong, please [report](https://github.com/KaikoClanworth1/wwe-svr2011-pc/issues) it with the newest file from the game folder's `logs` folder.

**Set up (Desktop Mode):**

1. Download the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/KaikoClanworth1/wwe-svr2011-pc/releases/latest) and unzip it, for example into `~/Games/SvR2011-PC`. Copy your `.iso` onto the Deck or its SD card.
2. In Steam: **Games → Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library → Browse**. Set the file type to **All Files** and choose `SvR2011 Launcher.exe`.
3. In that entry's **Properties → Compatibility**, tick **Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool** and pick **Proton Experimental** (or the newest Proton).
4. Start it from Steam and use the **Install** tab as on Windows. In the file dialogs your Linux files are on drive **Z:**, for example `Z:\home\deck\Games`.

**Play in Game Mode:** add the game folder's `svr2011.exe` as another non-Steam game and force Proton on it the same way. It starts straight into the game with the Deck's controls, and is fullscreen by default on a Deck. You can also keep using the launcher entry and press **Play** (use the trackpad or touchscreen).

**Tips:**

- **Typing names:** press **Steam + X** for the Deck's keyboard. It types into the game's on-screen keyboard.
- **Entrance music:** MP3 is the safest format under Proton.
- **Custom movies:** the launcher's movie maker may not read every video format under Proton. If a video won't convert, convert it on a Windows PC, or try an H.264 `.mp4`.
- **Something draws wrong:** in the launcher's **Settings**, set **Renderer** to **Emulated** and compare.
- **Updates:** launchers before v0.3.0 can't unpack updates under Proton (they used Windows' `tar.exe`, which Proton lacks) and stop with "Could not unpack the update". Update once by hand: download the latest zip, unzip it over your launcher's folder (or unzip it anywhere, run its launcher and click **Install** into your game folder). From v0.3.0 on, updates work under Proton too.
- **DLC:** under Proton the launcher can unpack `.zip` DLC archives but not `.rar` or `.7z`. Unpack those first, or add the unpacked folder.

### Android

The game runs on Android phones and tablets with a 64-bit ARM chip and Vulkan, such as a recent Snapdragon. On a Galaxy Z Fold 7 it holds 60 fps, on both its screens. You need about 7 GB free on the phone. Play with a controller or the on-screen touch controls.

**All you need is the APK.** Download `SvR2011-Android-v<version>.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/KaikoClanworth1/wwe-svr2011-pc/releases/latest), open it on the phone to install it (allow installs from your browser or file manager if asked), and start it. Its **Install** tab installs the game from your own Xbox 360 disc image (ISO) on the phone. The app updates itself from new releases.

If the game is already installed on your PC, the launcher's **Android Install** tab can put it on the phone instead:

- **Option 1: install over USB.**
  1. On the phone, open **Settings → About phone** (on Samsung, also **→ Software information**) and tap **Build number** 7 times, until it says developer mode is on.
  2. Open **Settings → Developer options** and turn on **USB debugging**.
  3. Connect the phone with a USB data cable and unlock it. When it asks *Allow USB debugging?*, tick *Always allow from this computer* and tap **Allow**.
  4. Click **Install to phone**. The first time, the launcher downloads adb, Google's Android tool (about 7 MB).

  The game goes into the phone's `games/WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011` folder and starts. Run it again after a launcher update: it copies only what changed and keeps the phone's saves.
- **Option 2: a package to copy yourself.** **Create APK Package** makes a folder with `SvR2011.apk`, `SvR2011-Game.zip` and instructions. Copy both files to the phone's **Download** folder and open the APK to install it. On first start the app installs the game from the zip; you can delete the zip afterwards.

**Touch controls:** the menus get a simple pad (D-pad, A/B/X/Y, bumpers, triggers, Start/Back). Matches get a move stick, a grapple stick, the face buttons labelled with what they do (strike, action, whip/pin, finisher), reversal, run, drag, submission and taunts, plus a **?** button with the full match controls. They switch by themselves when a match starts, or with the button at the top left. **EDIT** (top right) lets you drag, resize, hide or remap any control and set their opacity. The controls hide as soon as a controller is connected and come back for a while when you touch the screen. **MY WWE → Options → Graphics → Touch controls** turns them off.

**Graphics drivers (Adreno):** the app's **Settings → Graphics driver** takes driver packages such as Mesa Turnip or Qualcomm's (the zips other emulators use, or a driver's `.so`). **Driver variables** are set before the driver loads; on HyperOS 3 phones with graphical glitches, pick a Turnip driver and tap **Add the HyperOS 3 fix** (`FD_DEV_FEATURES=enable_tp_ubwc_flag_hint=1`). A driver that doesn't start falls back to the phone's own.

**Adreno 710 / 720 / 722** (e.g. Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 / 7 Gen 3 phones and tablets): the app comes with two Mesa Turnip drivers that players found run the game well. The launcher offers the recommended one (v4.1) the first time, or pick it in **Settings → Graphics driver**. These GPUs' own drivers are often too old for the Native renderer.

**Mali GPUs** 🧪 (alpha): not supported yet. **Settings → Mali GPU (alpha)** lets the game try. If you do, please send a problem report (**Report a problem**) whether it works or not.

On the phone, the game renders at the Xbox 360's 720p with shadows and effects at their original size. **MY WWE → Options → Graphics → Quality** raises them, and anti-aliasing can be turned on there.

---

## Controls

Play with an Xbox controller. The layout is exactly as on the Xbox 360.

**While playing:**

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `F2` | Shows or hides the FPS counter. |
| `F3` | Performance overlay. |
| `F4` | The runtime's settings overlay. |
| `` ` `` | Console and log. |

**Typing:** whenever the game's on-screen keyboard is open (superstar names, Story Designer, and so on), you can type on your PC keyboard as well as use the controller. `Backspace` deletes, `←` `→` move the cursor, `Enter` confirms and `Esc` cancels.

The game's main menu has an **EXIT** entry at the bottom.

---

## Settings

You can change these in the launcher's **Settings** tab. **Resolution**, **Display mode**, **Anti-aliasing**, **VSync**, **FPS counter** and **Renderer** are also in the game itself, under **My WWE → Options → Graphics**. Everything is saved in `svr2011.toml` beside the exe.

The in-game **Graphics** page has two tabs (**LB / RB**). **Display** holds the settings above. **Quality** trades looks for speed; its changes apply at once:

| Quality setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Render resolution** | The most the game renders at. **Auto** (default) fills your screen. **720p (Xbox 360)**, **1440p** and **2160p** cap it; lower is faster on weaker GPUs. |
| **Anti-aliasing** | As in the launcher. |
| **Textures** | **High** (default): as the game has them. **Medium** / **Low**: big textures use the game's own half / quarter-size versions, a quarter / a sixteenth of the memory and upload work, for weak phones and PCs. Menus, fonts and pictures stay sharp. Also in both launchers' Settings. |
| **Shadows & effects** | **High**: shadows, reflections and glow at the render resolution. **Normal**: at the Xbox 360's size, much less GPU work at high resolutions. |
| **Entrance frame rate** | **60 fps** (default), or **30 fps** as on the Xbox 360: entrances and cutscenes then need half the work. |
| **Wide screens** | **Full width** (default): on screens wider or narrower than 16:9, matches and entrances fill the screen with a wider (or taller) view; the HUD and menus stay 16:9. **16:9** keeps the original picture with bars. |

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Windowed / Fullscreen** | Fullscreen is borderless. |
| **Resolution** | 1280×720 is the console's own output and the default. 1600×900, 1920×1080, 2560×1440 and 3840×2160 render the game at a higher internal resolution. |
| **VSync** | Waits for the monitor's refresh, so the picture doesn't tear. On by default. |
| **Anti-aliasing** | Renders at twice the resolution and averages it down, for smoother edges. It costs GPU time. |
| **Renderer** | **Native** (recommended) draws the game's Direct3D calls directly. **Emulated** emulates the Xbox 360's graphics chip, as Xenia does. Try it if something looks wrong, and please report it. **Native Vulkan (EXPERIMENTAL)** is the native renderer on Vulkan instead of Direct3D 12 (the groundwork for Linux and Android); it needs a Vulkan 1.2 GPU and falls back to emulated drawing if it can't start. |
| **Show FPS** | The frame-rate counter at the top of the window (`F2` in game). |
| **Language** | The game's text: English, French, German, Spanish or Italian. It applies the next time the game starts; the commentary is always English. Also in game (**Display** tab). |
| **Controller API** | **XInput** for Xbox controllers, or **SDL** for other gamepads. |
| **Audio output** | **XAudio2** (recommended; 5.1 on surround setups, stereo otherwise) or **SDL**. **Mute** silences the game. |

## Features

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/entrance-media.svg" alt="Your music and your videos, used in Create An Entrance" width="100%">
</p>

### Entrance music from your PC

On the Xbox 360, *Create An Entrance → Finalize → Music → **USER PLAYLIST*** played songs from the console's hard drive. On PC, it plays them from the **`Music`** folder in the game folder. The launcher's **Settings → Open Music folder** button opens it.

```
Music\
  My Theme\
    song.mp3        listed as MY THEME
  The Champ\
    entrance.m4a    listed as THE CHAMP
  Walkout.mp3       a song put straight in Music is listed by its file name
```

- Give each song **its own folder**. The folder's name is what the game lists.
- `.mp3`, `.wma`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.wav` and `.flac` all work.
- The entrance remembers the song by name, so **don't rename a folder that an entrance uses**.
- The song plays in the entrance and in the preview (**X**). The game's own music lowers while it plays, as on the console.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/user-playlist.jpg" alt="USER PLAYLIST in Create An Entrance" width="70%"></p>

### Custom entrance movies

The launcher's **Movies** tab turns any video Windows can play (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.wmv`, …) into an entrance movie for the arena's big screen.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/launcher-movies.png" alt="Launcher Movies tab" width="60%"></p>

1. Under **Video**, choose your video. A frame from it shows in the preview. You can also choose a movie you made before (a `.bik` in `Custom Movies`) to make it again, for example with **Fill the screen**.
2. Under **Bottom strip**, choose what the stage and ramp screens show: a picture or a video (**Browse…**), **Superstar…** to reuse a superstar's animated strip from the game's own movie (DLC superstars included), or **None (black)**.
3. Choose how the video fits the big screen: **Fill the screen** (the default: the video covers the whole screen, cutting off a little at the edges if its shape differs), **Whole picture** (black bars if needed) or **Stretch**. Black bars that are already in the video (letterboxed or 4:3 videos) are found and cut off first.
4. Pick a **Length**, give the movie a **Name**, and click **Make movie**. A 30-second movie takes a few seconds to make.
5. In the game: *Create An Entrance → Finalize → **Movie** → **USER MOVIES***, like *Music → USER PLAYLIST*. It lists your movies by name (and any saved highlight reels after them). **X** previews one, **A** picks it.

The movies are saved in the **`Custom Movies`** folder in the game folder, in the same format and layout as the game's own titantron movies. Don't rename a movie that an entrance uses (`Custom Movies\ids.txt` remembers which number each one has).

    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/custom-movie-entrance.jpg" alt="Custom movie in an entrance"><br><sub>…and on the big screen during the entrance</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Up to 10 HD logos per superstar

The game lets a created superstar wear only **2** different High Resolution (256×256) Paint Tool logos. The port raises that to **10**, so you can put a different logo on the head, chest, back, arms, legs and clothing.

- Logos 1 and 2 are stored in the superstar's save as usual. Logos 3 to 10 are kept in the hidden **`Saves\.logos`** folder, and the launcher's backups include it.
- If you copy or share a superstar's save file by hand, **copy `Saves\.logos` with it**, or logos 3 and up will be blank.
- The game's other rules stay: Low Resolution (128×128) logos stay at 10, and the two sizes can't be mixed on one superstar.
- **Tip:** a superstar's **Entrance Attire** and **Cinematic Attire** are separate outfits. If you don't edit them, entrances and cutscenes use the game's default gear. To see the full costume in the entrance, build it in *Other → Edit Entrance Attire* too.

    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/caw-logos-match.jpg" alt="The same superstar in a match"><br><sub>The same superstar in a match</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Paint Tool import and export

The launcher's **Paint Tool** tab shows the game's 20 Paint Tool logos.

- **Import image…** puts any picture into a logo. It's fitted into 256×256 and keeps its transparency. The game then shows and edits it like any logo.
- **Export PNG…** and **Export all…** save logos as PNGs.
- **Delete logo** empties a slot.

The Paint Tool save is created the first time you open *Create A Superstar → Paint Tool* in the game.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/launcher-paint.png" alt="Launcher Paint Tool tab" width="60%"></p>

### Saves

Every save is **one plain file** in the `Saves\` folder. Close the game before you copy them.

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `SaveData.dat` | The main save: settings, unlocks and progress. It ties the others together, so keep them with it. |
| `00CreateSuperStar.cas`, `01…` | Created superstars. |
| `00PaintTool.pt` | Paint Tool logos. |
| `00RecordingDat.rec` | Replays. |
| `00SceneDat.scn` | Highlight reels. |

The launcher's **Saves** tab lists them. You can **Back up all** (to `SaveBackups\`), **Restore backup**, **Export** or **Import** single saves, **Delete** (to the Recycle Bin) and open the folder. Restoring or importing backs up your current saves first. **Saves folder → Change…** puts the saves somewhere else (for example to keep two installs' saves apart, or to share them); it offers to copy your current saves over. **Default** goes back to the game folder's `Saves`.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/launcher-saves.png" alt="Launcher Saves tab" width="60%"></p>

### DLC

Downloadable content from the Xbox 360 (superstars, moves, arenas) works. In the launcher's **DLC** tab, choose the folder with your DLC packages, as downloaded on the console. `.zip`, `.rar` and `.7z` archives of them work too. Click **Install DLC**. The packages are copied into the game's `DLC\` folder and unpacked the next time the game starts. Title updates aren't needed and are skipped.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/launcher-dlc.png" alt="Launcher DLC tab" width="60%"></p>

### Texture packs

Texture packs replace the game's textures with new ones, at any resolution, as in Dolphin. In the launcher's **Texture packs** tab, add a pack (a folder or a `.zip`) and tick it. Ticked packs are used the next time the game starts, and a pack higher in the list wins over the ones below it. Packs live in the game folder's `Texture Packs\`. On Android, copy pack folders into the phone's game folder (`Texture Packs`), then switch them on in the launcher's **Settings**.

**Making a pack:** tick **Dump textures** and play. The game writes every texture it shows to `Texture Dumps\`, as PNG, once each. Files are named after the game's own textures, with a code at the end, for example `menuHD_brandlogo_RAW_7239e21ccf9832e0.png` or `ch100_a0_normal_....png`. Textures the game makes while running get `tex_<size>_<format>_<code>.png`. Edit a file at any size, keep its name (the code at the end is what counts), and put it anywhere in your pack's folder. PNG and DDS (DXT1/3/5 or 32-bit, with mipmaps) both work. Packs aren't affected by **Textures** quality: a pack's texture always shows at its own size. The first dump indexes the game's files for the names (about half a minute, once).

### Mods and the Mod Maker

Mods add things to the game without touching its files: arenas, backstage rooms, superstars, moves, crowd signs, media packs and match types, each a single `.svrmod` file. The launcher's **Mods** tab installs them (**+**), lists them with a tick to switch each on or off, and ships with the bundled ones. Mods live in the game folder's `Mods\`; the game lays them over its own files when it starts.

The **Mod Maker** (Mods tab → **Open Mod Maker**) makes them: a 3D arena editor with a Blender round trip, superstar mods from any character model with their theme, entrance video, attires and pictures, move packs, crowd signs, media packs, match types, converters for WWE '13 / SvR 2010 / SvR 2008 content, your Created Superstars' pictures, and viewers for every file, animation and picture in the game. **The full guide, with pictures, diagrams and step-by-step tutorials: [kaikoclanworth1.github.io/wwe-svr2011-pc](https://kaikoclanworth1.github.io/wwe-svr2011-pc/)** (also next to the Mod Maker as *Mod Maker Guide*, and on its Manual page). The `.svrmod` format is documented in [docs/SVRMOD_FORMAT.md](docs/SVRMOD_FORMAT.md).

### Achievements

The game's 39 achievements (1,000 gamerscore) unlock as they did on the Xbox 360, with a pop-up when you earn one. **MY WWE → ACHIEVEMENTS** lists them all. You can see which you've unlocked and when, your gamerscore, and how to earn each one. Use the D-pad to choose, **LB** / **RB** to page, **Y** to show all, unlocked or locked, and **B** to go back. Three need Xbox LIVE (two Royal Rumble online matches and uploading to Community Creations), so they can't be earned in the port. Unlocks are kept in the game folder's `UserData\achievements\`.

## Building from source

The recompiled game code is **generated on your machine from your own disc**. It isn't stored here.

**You need:**

- **Windows 10 or 11**, 64-bit.
- **LLVM** (`clang`, `clang++` and `llvm-rc`) in `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`.
- **CMake 3.25** or newer, and **Ninja**.
- **Git** and **Python 3** with Pillow: run `pip install pillow`.
- **PowerShell**.

**Steps** (run them from the repository root):

1. Get the **ReXGlue SDK** source into `recomp\rexglue-sdk`, at the commit this port was built against (its v0.10.0 release commit):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk recomp/rexglue-sdk
   ```
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/rexglue-sdk checkout c94f5ebdcb3c9d1a460ca48e04f9758448f8d518
   ```
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/rexglue-sdk submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Apply this port's runtime fixes to the SDK:
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/rexglue-sdk apply ../../port/patches/rexglue-sdk-svr2011.patch
   ```
   And get **plume** (the graphics layer the native renderer draws through) into `recomp\plume`, with this port's additions:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/renderbag/plume.git recomp/plume
   ```
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/plume checkout d72379344dacd3dbf9f810f92ddc87e6de1845b1
   ```
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/plume submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
   ```bash
   git -C recomp/plume apply ../../port/patches/plume-svr2011.patch
   ```
3. Get the **ReXGlue codegen tool**: download `rexglue-sdk-0.10.0-win-amd64.zip` from the [ReXGlue releases](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and unzip it into `recomp\sdk\win-amd64`.
4. Put **`ninja.exe`** in `recomp\bin`, or anywhere on your `PATH`.
5. Copy **`default.xex`** from your disc (or from an install made by the launcher) into `port\assets\`.
6. Optionally, make the **program icon** from your game files:
   ```bash
   python port/tools/make_icon.py "path/to/your/game folder"
   ```
7. **Generate** the C++ code from your `default.xex` (about a minute):
   ```bash
   cd port && ../recomp/sdk/win-amd64/bin/rexglue.exe codegen svr2011_manifest.toml
   ```
8. **Build** (the first build takes a while):
   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File port/build.ps1
   ```
9. Optionally, the **native renderer's shaders**: they're converted from the game's own shaders as it creates them (a capture build, then `port/tools/convert_shaders.py`, which makes DXIL for Direct3D 12 and SPIR-V for Vulkan; see `port/docs/native_renderer_phase2.md`). Without them the game uses the emulated renderer.
10. **Make a release zip**, with no game data in it, then install it with its launcher as in [Install and play](#install-and-play):
   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File port/tools/package.ps1
   ```

**Android (work in progress, not yet tested on a phone):** the same code cross-compiled for arm64 with the Android NDK, drawn with the Vulkan renderer. You need JDK 17 and the Android SDK command-line tools with `ndk;30.0.16248370`, `build-tools;36.1.0` and `platforms;android-36`. Set `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` if they're not in `D:\Android`. Gradle isn't needed. Build the SDK for Windows first (step 8, which makes the `rexglue.exe` code generator), then run:
```bash
python port/tools/build_apk.py
```
This makes `port/out/android/SvR2011.apk`, which holds no game data. The package script ships it beside the launcher as `Android\SvR2011.apk`, and on its own as `SvR2011-Android-v<version>.apk` for the release. The launcher's **Install → Create APK Package** puts it next to a zip of the installed game. On first start, the app installs that zip into the phone's `games` folder.

**Repository layout:**

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `port/src/` | The PC side: the app, audio, input, saves, DLC, menus, the graphics page, entrance music and movies, the extra logos, crash reports and the native renderer. |
| `port/launcher/` | The Win32 launcher (Play, Settings, Install, DLC, Saves, Paint Tool and Movies tabs), including the Bink movie encoder and the Android packager. |
| `port/android/` | The Android app's manifest, icons and Java activities (the game runs in SDL's activity). |
| `port/patches/` | Fixes to the ReXGlue SDK's runtime that this game needs. |
| `port/tools/` | Build, packaging and analysis scripts, and the background test harness. |
| `port/svr2011_manifest.toml`, `port/svr2011_config.toml` | The codegen project and its per-game settings. |

## Troubleshooting

- **The install fails.** Check that the image is a full disc image of the **Xbox 360** version, and that the target drive has enough free space (the Install tab shows it).
- **The game closed unexpectedly.** A crash report is saved in `UserData\crashes\` in the game folder. Please include it when you report a problem.
- **Black screen with sound (v0.1.0).** v0.1.0's zip was missing the native renderer's shaders. Update to v0.2.0 or later. The game now also falls back to the **Emulated** renderer if the `native_shaders` folder is missing.
- **"The Created Superstar save data is either damaged or missing" after copying saves.** Choose **NO**, then update to v0.2.1 or later: it rebuilds the save headers that some copy tools leave out (the `Saves\.info` folder), and copies the whole `Saves` folder from then on.
- **Very low frame rate or no picture on a laptop.** Laptops with two GPUs could run the game on the built-in one. v0.2.1 picks the fast GPU. With older versions, set `svr2011.exe` to **High performance** in Windows Settings → System → Display → Graphics.
- **Entrances or matches run slow on a weaker PC.** In **My WWE → Options → Graphics → Quality**, set **Shadows & effects** to **Normal**, lower **Render resolution** (720p is the console's), turn off **Anti-aliasing**, set **Textures** to **Medium** (low memory or slow loading), and if entrances still stutter, set **Entrance frame rate** to **30 fps**. On Vulkan and on phones, the first time a scene is shown can hitch while its shaders are prepared; they're kept in `UserData\cache\` for the next time.
- **Something is drawn wrong.** In the launcher's **Settings**, set **Renderer** to **Emulated** and see if it looks right there. Either way, please report it with a screenshot.
- **My entrance song or movie is gone.** The entrance remembers it by name. Check that the folder in `Music\`, or the movie in `Custom Movies\`, still has the same name.
- **A superstar's logos 3 and up are blank.** Their images are in `Saves\.logos`. Restore it from a backup, or copy it along with the superstar's save.
- **The costume is missing in the entrance.** Edit the superstar's **Entrance Attire** (see the tip under [HD logos](#up-to-10-hd-logos-per-superstar)).
- **Online modes** aren't available in this port.
