// WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 - native renderer textures and samplers.
//
// Guest textures are described by Xenos texture fetch constants (the device
// register mirror, 6 dwords per slot). Each distinct texture is uploaded once
// into a GPU texture: the guest data is detiled, endian-swapped and, for the
// few formats the host lacks, converted on the CPU; the layout of the mips
// and the packed mip tail comes from the SDK's Xenia texture utilities, so it
// matches the emulated renderer. Textures are re-checked against guest memory
// every so often (streamed textures reuse memory).
